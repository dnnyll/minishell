# Basic output redirection
echo hello > file.txt

# Expected result:
# file.txt contains "hello\n"

NOT CREATING file.txt



# Output append redirection
echo world >> file.txt

# Expected result:
# file.txt now contains:
# hello
# world



# Input redirection
cat < file.txt

# Expected result:
# hello
# world



# Output redirection overwrite
echo overwritten > file.txt

# Expected result:
# file.txt contains "overwritten\n"



# Input + Output redirection (invalid order in bash)
cat < file.txt > out.txt

# Expected result:
# out.txt contains the content of file.txt:
# overwritten



# Redirection with missing file (input)
cat < non_existing.txt

# Expected result:
# bash: non_existing.txt: No such file or directory



# Output redirection with permission denied (read-only file)
touch readonly.txt && chmod 444 readonly.txt
echo test > readonly.txt

# Expected result:
# bash: readonly.txt: Permission denied

# File descriptor aggregation (redirect stderr to stdout)
ls notfound 2>&1

# Expected result:
# ls: cannot access 'notfound': No such file or directory

# Redirect stdout and stderr to file
ls notfound > out.txt 2>&1

# Expected result:
# out.txt contains:
# ls: cannot access 'notfound': No such file or directory

# Redirect stdout only (stderr still in terminal)
ls notfound > out.txt

# Expected result:
# out.txt is empty
# ls error printed on terminal

# Close stdout
echo hello 1>&-

# Expected result:
# bash: echo: write error: Bad file descriptor

# Chain of redirections
echo test > a.txt > b.txt

# Expected result:
# 'b.txt' contains "test\n"
# 'a.txt' is empty or contains nothing (bash behavior)

# Multiple redirections with append
echo first >> a.txt >> b.txt

# Expected result:
# Both a.txt and b.txt contain "first\n" appended

# Here-document basic
cat << EOF
line 1
line 2
EOF

# Expected result:
# line 1
# line 2

# Here-document with tab suppression
cat <<- EOF
	line with tab
EOF

# Expected result:
# line with tab

# Here-document with quoted delimiter (no expansion)
cat << 'EOF'
$HOME
EOF

# Expected result:
# $HOME

# Here-document with expansion
cat << EOF
$HOME
EOF

# Expected result:
# [your home directory path]
